# Cheerful Cinnamon Churros

Churros are a classic Spanish dessert that can make your day! This sugary snack is rumored to have been created by shepherds so they could satisfy their sweet tooth while tending to their flocks of sheep in the high mountains of Spain. Â¡Que aproveche!

## Ingredients

- 3 teaspoons of ground cinnamon (or a pinch extra if you're feeling adventurous)
- 2 tablespoons of granulated white sugar (for making dough)
- 1/2 cup of granulated white sugar (for cinnamon coating)
- 1 cup of water
- 1 cup of all-purpose flour
- 2 1/2 tablespoons of white granulated sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon of salt
- 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil (to heat pan)
- 4 cups of vegetable oil (for deep frying)


## Tools

- Small bowl
- Saucepan
- Deep-fryer or deep skillet (for deep frying the dough, so make sure it has some depth)
- Baking sheet
- Paper towels
- Piping bag (alternatively, you could use a press-seal bag and snip the corner)
- Slotted spoon 

## Method

Over medium heat, combine water, salt, 2 tablespoons of sugar, and 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in small saucepan. Bring to a boil and remove from heat. 
Stir in flour until mixture thickens. Remove from heat. Once thick enough, you will use this as your dough.
Take the dough and put it into a pastry/piping bag. 
Heat oil for frying in deep-fryer or deep skillet to 375 degrees F. 
Prep your baking sheet by laying paper towels on it.
Using the pastry bag, pipe strips of the dough into the hot oil. (Be careful!)
Fry the dough until golden brown.
Remove the churro using the slotted spoon and place on paper towels.
Combine 1/2 cup sugar and ground cinnamon in a small bowl. 
Roll drained churros in cinnamon and sugar mixture.
Enjoy! I recommend eating the churros with some hot chocolate. 

## Tips

Take your time with this recipe. Sometimes it can be hard to pipe the dough, so don't worry if the shape isn't perfect! Also, you can change the shape of your churros by using different piping bag tips.
